# 21/08/24 - ChatRooms (#14)
This is a basic UI for a theoretical front page of a chat room app with no routes. This is my first UI from scratch in this miniproject series so I have a lot to learn. Once I improve in my UI knowledge, I will be able to articulate exactly why it isn't very good but it looks very bland (instead of simple which was what I was going for) probably due to my elementary knowledge of color theory for websites. Also, I tried to put in too many styling features in this UI without understanding how to use them correctly which makes it seem a bit disoriented. I think what I should do in the future is focus on one feature (e.g. chat boxes), study the feature from multiple apps and try to emulate what makes it professional. 

Self-criticisms aside, I want to eventually be able to create my own UI's from scratch to a standard that looks indifferent to a professional website from an average person's perspective. Creating my own (flawed) UI's with these miniprojects will hopefully finally give me that healthy feedback mechanism instead of just passively implementing UI's created by others and only partially absorbing the process. It's like drawing exclusively from references rather than practising to draw from observation. You will only be able to replicate pictures rather than what you want to create.
